            <h4>Tokubetsu</h4>
            <h1>Honjozo</h1>
            <p>Our Tokubetsu Honjozo is a traditional sake, made using high quality rice that has been lightly milled to remove 40% of the outer (bran) layer of the rice. Lighter in style than other sakes, this has a crisp, dry and easy to drink style. A discrete nose with lime, lemon and straw. The palate is dry with hints of citrus flavours. A smooth and well balanced sake.</p>

            <h1>Honjozo Genshu</h1>
            <p>An undiluted sake from Akashi-Tai, fuller in body and with a more concentrated flavour. This is the drink the brew-masters reach for at the end of a working day. Full bodied with woody aroma, very rich. Creamy texture, with well balanced flavours with hints of citrus fruits. Long lingering finish.</p>

            <p>Our Tokubetsu Junmai begins with 100% Yamadanishiki rice grown in Hyogo Prefecture which is polished until only 60% of the grain is left. This sake is lovingly handcrafted in every step of the process, from making Koji Rice to hand bottling.</p>
            <p>Akashi-Tai Tokubetsu Junmai is a traditional brew with a satisfyingly full bodied flavour profile, clean and well structured.</p>

            <h1>Daiginjo Genshu</h1>
            <p>Our Daiginjo Genshu is a luxuriously aromatic, medium-bodied sake made only in the mid-late winter months from the highest grade Yamadanishiki rice. This sake is perfect for both connoisseurs and those who are just starting to discover.</p>
            <p>A brew master watches over the koji for 72 hours — without sleeping — to ensure the absolute finest of sakes. A fruity fragrance can be detected amid the full-bodied flavour. Elegant aromas of honey, lily and pear. Delicate flavours of white flowers with a subtle hint of anise. Lemony dry finish.</p>

            <h1>Junmai Daiginjo Genshu</h1>
            <p>Made using highly prized Yamadanishiki rice grown in a district of Hyogo. This fine rice is polished until only 38% of the  grain remains, after which two full months are devoted to nurturing our Junmai Daiginjo Genshu sake to completion. Well pronounced nose with melon, lemon, bitter orange, green grass and sage. Very nice balance of minerals, lemon and bitter orange flavours to give a long lasting finish without ever overpowering. A sake you can keep drinking throughout a meal or a long evening with friends.</p>

A true artisan sake, handmade in small batches by our Toji (master brewer) Yonezawa-san and his close team of trusted craftsmen.

Most notably the rice and the water, both of which Hyogo is renowned for throughout Japan and the wider sake world.</p>

            <p>It may sound obvious, but rice is what makes the sake. And respect for the rice is what gives the sake character. You need to treat the rice with integrity, use the right water, know which variety to use at each stage of the process, proceed at as slow a pace as much precision as those processes demand, and most of all not cut corners where others might say you can get away with it.</p>
            <p>For example, in our Daiginjos we use 100% Hyogo produced Yamadanishiki both for koji-making and for mashing, not just where we think you’ll notice it most.</p>
            <p>Because the quest for perfection is all about incremental gains.</p>

            <p>The fertile land around Akashi is ideal for rice-growing, and plenty of clean fresh springs supply the region with the purest water. These conditions mean it has become as famous for sake as it is for seafood. We aim to reveal and celebrate the diversity of taste that the different rice varieties can offer, not to drive for the homogenous erosion of taste and character.</p>
            <p>To achieve this goal, to find the true soul of the rice, you sometimes need to go to greater lengths and respect even elaborate details. For example, at ASB we brew using the same water that’s used to cultivate the Yamadanishiki in the first place.</p>
            <p>Some would say that won’t make any difference, we think that circles should be closed.</p>
